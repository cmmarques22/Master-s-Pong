# Master-s-Pong

I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of four fellow students on an exciting programming challenge. 

Our challenge was to develop a game within one week using Java and a simple Java Graphics library. The challenge started with brainstorming ideas and quickly narrowing down our options. We finally settled on developing a fast-paced pong game. This was made using our knowledege from 4 weeks of bootcamp.
